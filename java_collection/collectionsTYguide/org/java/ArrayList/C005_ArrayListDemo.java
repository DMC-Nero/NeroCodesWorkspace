/*
	 1. An ArrayList is re-sizable array, also called a dynamic array. It grows its size to 
		accommodate new elements and shrinks the size when the elements are removed.
	 2. ArrayList internally uses an array to store the elements. Just like arrays, it allows 
	 	you to retrieve the elements by their index.
	 3. Java ArrayList allows duplicate and null values.
	 4. Java ArrayList is an ordered collection. It maintains the insertion order of the 
	 	elements.
	 5. You cannot create an ArrayList of primitive types like int, char etc. You need to
	 	use boxed types like Integer, Character, Boolean etc.
	 
  	 Note:-	 Default capacity of an ArrayList is [10].
